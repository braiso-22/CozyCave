## Features

In the current stage of the app you can use 2 features, based on CRUD they are:

- Tasks(CRU) can't delete for the moment
- Executions(CR) can't update and delete for the moment

## Tecnology and methodoloty

- The project is fully made in Kotlin, with Jetpack Compose for the ui and Room for the local DB.
- As I am using Jetpack Compose it automatically has the dark mode and colors set depending on the device settings and wallpaper
- I'm following a clean architecture with MVVM, Usecases and Repositories

## Collaboration

- I'm open to collaboration, so if you want to make some inprovements to the code or you want to add a new feature create a PR
- If you don't know how to create a PR or you are to lazy to do one contact me on braisfv22@gmail.com to talk about your idea
